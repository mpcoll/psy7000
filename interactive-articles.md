In 1963, [Edward Lorenz](wiki:Edward_Norton_Lorenz), with the help of [](wiki:Ellen_Fetter) who was responsible for the numerical simulations and figures, and [Margaret Hamilton](<wiki:Margaret_Hamilton_(software_engineer)>) who helped in the initial, numerical computations leading up to the findings of the Lorenz model, developed a simplified mathematical model for [](wiki:atmospheric_convection). The model is a system of three ordinary differential equations now known as the Lorenz equations:
